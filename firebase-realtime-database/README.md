# Description

A sample for Firebase Realtime Database.  

The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client.  
When you build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.

# Required

You need to create a Firebase project, and download a ```google-services.json``` flie.  
After downloading the ```google-services.json```, copy this into your project's module folder, typically ```app/```.
